# Pathfinding Visualizer

This Javascript application is used to demonstrate a few different pathfinding algorithms from basic ones like Dijkstra's Algorithm to more complex ones like Jump Point Search. It also supports adding walls and different kinds of weights to make the pathfinding process more interesting and to better demonstrate the difference between the algorithms.

## Algorithms
Weighted: Dijkstra's Algorithm, A* Search, Greedy Best-First Search, Bidirectional Dijkstra's Algorithm, Bidirectional A* Search
Unweighted: Breadth-First Search, Depth-First Search, Jump Point Search
